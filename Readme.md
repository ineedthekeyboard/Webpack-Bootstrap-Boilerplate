# Webpack boilerplate project

### Idea
Basically this project contains a basic webpack setup to build an html template with its JS and SCSS dependencies
into a servable format.
The HTML setup is based on html boilerplate project.
It uses the main.js file to store all the global images+assets that need to be imported.

### Get started
To get started `npm i` and then run `npm start`
To build files for distribution run `npm run build`. Files to server will then be in the "/dist" folder.
